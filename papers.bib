abstract = "Anderson and Moore (1985) present a fail-safe method for analyzing any linear perfect-foresight model. They describe a procedure which either computes the reduced-form solution or indicates why the model has no reduced form. This paper presents formulae for differentiating singular vectors and vectors spanning an invariant space, and shows how to use these formulae to differentiate Anderson and Moore's structural-model to reduced-form-model transformation.
