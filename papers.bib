 title = {Automatic Differentiation in Linear Algebra and Statistics},
 abstract = {Automatic Differentiation (AD) refers to a number of techniques for
 evaluating computational sensitivities.  These techniques are very
 different from Symbolic Differentiation and Finite Differencing and
 almost certainly should be used more broadly. I will talk about two
 very different versions of AD : the first augments computer code to
 generate derivative values while the second applies standard calculus
 tools in unusual ways.  Historically the second approach originated
 (1950s) in Maximum Likelihood Estimation and error estimates in
 Numercal Linear Algebra.  Recently both approaches have been used in
 economic forecasting and options pricing. The presentation should be
 accessible to anyone with minimal linear algebra background.
 Specifically I intend to exhibit derivatives of LU, QR, and various
 spectral decompositions.}

  title = {An extended collection of matrix derivative results for forward and reverse mode algorithmic differentiation},
  author = {Giles, Mike},
  abstract = {This paper collects together a number of matrix derivative results which are very useful in forward and reverse mode algorithmic differentiation (AD). It highlights in particular the remarkable contribution of a 1948 paper by Dwyer and Macphail which derives the linear and adjoint sensitivities of a matrix product, inverse and determinant, and a number of related results motivated by applications in multivariate analysis in statistics. This is an extended version of a paper which will appear in the proceedings of AD2008, the 5th International Conference on Automatic Differentiation.},

They describe a procedure which either computes the reduced-form solution or indicates why the model has no reduced form. This paper presents formulae for differentiating singular vectors and vectors spanning an invariant space, and shows how to use these formulae to differentiate Anderson and Moore's structural-model to reduced-form-model transformation.
